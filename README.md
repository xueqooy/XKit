## Tools in XKit

XKit provides a variety of useful tools for developers:

### Core Tools

- **`OrderedDictionary`**: An ordered key-value collection, preserving the insertion order of keys.
- **`ArrayBuilder.swift`**: A utility for constructing arrays with a builder pattern.
- **`Asserts.swift`**: Assertions for debugging and testing purposes.
- **`Association.swift`**: For associating objects with keys (like Objective-C associated objects).
- **`Atomic.swift`**: Provides thread-safe atomic operations for properties.
- **`Cancellable.swift`**: A wrapper for cancellable operations, useful for managing async tasks.
- **`Error.swift`**: A set of error handling utilities, including custom error types.
- **`HashtagRegex.swift`**: Regular expression utilities for parsing hashtags.
- **`InputOutputProviding.swift`**: Protocols and implementations for handling input and output operations.
- **`Lock.swift`**: Implements locking mechanisms for thread synchronization.
- **`Logs.swift`**: Logging utilities for better debugging and runtime logging.

### Data and State Management

- **`Mock.swift`**: Mock data generator for testing purposes.
- **`Once.swift`**: A utility for ensuring a block of code is executed only once.
- **`PagingDataManager.swift`**: Handles paging and data fetching in a paginated API.
- **`PasswordStrengthMeter.swift`**: A utility to assess and measure password strength.
- **`Pipe.swift`**: A simple utility for data piping and transformation.
- **`Queue.swift`**: A thread-safe queue for managing tasks.
- **`Random.swift`**: Provides methods for generating random numbers and values.
- **`Reachability.swift`**: A utility for checking network reachability and status.
- **`ReachabilityObserver.swift`**: An observer for changes in network reachability status.
- **`RetryIf.swift`**: A utility to retry an operation if certain conditions are met.
- **`Runtime.swift`**: Utilities for working with runtime-related information, such as class names or methods.
- **`SerialQueue.swift`**: A serial queue for managing tasks that must run sequentially.
- **`StateObservable.swift`**: A reactive state management utility for observing state changes.

### Utility Extensions

- **`String+Trim.swift`**: Adds string trimming methods to remove leading and trailing whitespace.
- **`SwiftyJSON.swift`**: A wrapper around JSON handling, simplifying parsing and serialization.
- **`TextComponentParser.swift`**: A utility for parsing and extracting components from text.
- **`Then.swift`**: A utility for method chaining, enabling a more fluent syntax.
- **`Timer.swift`**: A timer utility with support for delayed actions.
- **`TriState.swift`**: A representation of a value that can be in one of three states (e.g., true, false, or undefined).
- **`UndoRedoManager.swift`**: A manager to handle undo and redo actions in your app.
- **`ValueValidation.swift`**: Utilities for validating values such as strings, numbers, or other data types.
- **`Weak.swift`**: A utility to create weak references to objects, preventing retain cycles.
